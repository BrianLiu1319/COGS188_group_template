    "\n",
    "This project will be on the classic game Tetris. The goal is to have the AI be able to make the optimal move and continually clear lines of tetris pieces or tetriminos. The data that is being used is just a simple tetris game and is measured by its score to see if it is able to clear lines. Other arbitrary measurements will be the shape of the tetris stack and having the game over screen be the ultimate punishment. The game is over when our tetris stack exceeds the limit and the success will be measured by the score."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetris is a tile-matching game developed on JUne 6, 1984. Tetris has been used frequently as a subject of intrest in the field of AI and game theory because of the game's simplicity and complexity at the same time. Algorithms such as heuristic searchs such as A-star <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/8/2585) and genetic algorithms have been used to evaluate each possible move. Reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning or Markov Decision Processes have been used to train AI agents to play Tetris at a high level of proficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetris have found to be an NP-complete <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://medium.com/smith-hcv/np-completeness-of-tetris-ebbb24c7ba7a) meaning it is a perfect and valuable tool to examine the limits of AI optimization techniques and their applications as finding an optimal solution is pretty much impossible as the game goes on.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem is to find an algorithm that optimizes each move played in Tetris. Meaning each move is able to maximize the score gained every time a line is cleared in tetris. Because there are nearly infinite amount of moves because of the placement of our random bag of tetris pieces and our current game state of Tetris, it makes an AI algorithm perfect to see if we can find the best move for each piece. We will be employing reinforcement learning or Q-learning to learn the optimal action-value function. This problem is quantifiable because each move and piece that we employ are notably finite and we have a constant observation of our tetris stack. We can quantify how optimal our algorithm is by our score and it is definitely replicable because the game of tetris can always be replayed."
